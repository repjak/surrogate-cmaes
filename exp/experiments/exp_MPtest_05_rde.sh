# job submittion can be done via one of the two bash functions:
#
# (a) subtask [JOBNAME_SUFFIX]
#
#     submits a job with current-set $ID, $DIM, $FUNC, $INST and $OPTS
#
#
# (b) submit_sequence LOW_IDX STEP HIGH_IDX
#
#     call subtask() with 'modelOptionsIndices' set to a small
#     numbers of model-settings;
#     it submits a job for every $2 consecutive modelOptions' indices
#
#     e.g.: submit 11 4 22
#     submits jobs for the following modelOption indices:
#       - 11:14
#       - 15:18
#       - 19:22
#
#     Important: the HIGH_IDX should be the equal to (k*LOW_IDX) - 1
#                for some k


# critical characters has to be replaced in $OPTS:
# '|' with ',' and "%" with "'"
